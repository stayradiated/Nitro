# Nitro 2 #

## Installation ##

Nitro 2 is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and uses the [SpineJS](http://spinejs.com/) framework.

### Installing ###

    git clone https://github.com/stayradiated/Nitro.git
    cd Nitro
    npm install .

### Local Development Server ###

    # Compile and serve on port 9294
    cake server

    # Compile, watch and serve on port 9294
    cake -w server

    # Compile, watch and serve on port 8080
    cake -w -p 8080 server

You should now open up [http://localhost:9294](http://localhost:9294) and be using Nitro 2.
If you use the `-w` parameter, then any changes you make to the `*.coffee` or `*.sass` files will automatically be
compiled. 

### Build Nitro ###
    
Use these commands to compile and minify the app into the public folder.

    # Build once
    cake build
    
    # Build and watch
    cake -w build

    # Minify application.js
    cake minify
    
### Building Nitro on Windows

If you are using Windows then you will not be able to use the `cake` commands above.
However you can still compile Nitro by installing browserify as a global module.

    # Install browserify
    npm install -g browserify caching-coffeeify
    
    # Run from inside the Nitro folder
    browserify -t caching-coffeeify app/init.coffee -o public/application.js
    
    # You can compile the CSS using SASS
    sass css/index.scss:public/application.css
